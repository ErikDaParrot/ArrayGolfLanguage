# AGL
A golfing programming language derived from GolfScript and many array programming languages, combined to fit on the typable keyboard. 

**Status: still a bit unstable!!!**

Examples:
```
#{1+'**}%'\n$$p!                          ==> creates a star triangle
‘0s@-2/' $$                               ==> blur the text code-golf problem¹
#{1+.‘3%‘5%=‘0=&&vFB2\#:*‘+/:$&‘#$>p!}%   ==> fizzbuzz!
.##.‘==.{\‘_>|}|=                         ==> an identity matrix?
```

```
More features will be added later!
